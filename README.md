# Object-Detection-in-Video-using-PyTorch
A PyTorch-based project for vehicle and object detection in video frames. The notebook extracts video frames, applies object detection models, adds bounding boxes to detected objects, and stitches the frames back into a processed video. Uses OpenCV for video processing and stitching.
